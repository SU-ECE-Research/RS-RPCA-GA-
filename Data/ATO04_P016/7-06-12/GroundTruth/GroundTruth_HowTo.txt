How To "Ground Truth" an Image

1) Open MATLAB > Apps > Image Segmenter.
2) Load picture (for example: IMG_0031).
3) Use "Draw Foreground" to outline the foreground (cat).
   Suggestions:
   	Work in sections so if you mess up, there's less to redo.
	An open line connects a straight line between the two points. Use this trick to draw flat regions. 
4) Click the green check on "Export".
5) Rename:
	"GroundTruth_IMG_0031_BW"
	"GroundTruth_IMG_0031_mask"
6) Click to main MATLAB window > Workspace.
7) Right-click each, renaming:
	GroundTruth_IMG_0031_BW.mat
	GroundTruth_IMG_0031_mask.mat
   And saving in: \\ECEFS2\ResearchData\2018\RPCA(30SetRun)\Data\ATO04_P016\7-06-12\GroundTruth
8) Click to Command Window and execute:
	imwrite(GroundTruth_IMG_0031_BW, fullfile('\\ECEFS2\ResearchData\2018\RPCA(30SetRun)\Data\ATO04_P016\7-06-12\GroundTruth', 'GroundTruth_IMG_0031_BW.png'));
	imwrite(GroundTruth_IMG_0031_mask, fullfile('\\ECEFS2\ResearchData\2018\RPCA(30SetRun)\Data\ATO04_P016\7-06-12\GroundTruth', 'GroundTruth_IMG_0031_mask.png'));
9) Check that all four files were downloaded successfully.
10) Repeat steps 2-9 for all images!
